# Werewolf-Game

## Excercise in Procedural Ruby logic. 

The purpose of the game is for the player to locate the villagers who are actually wolves.
The player wins the game if they locate all the wolves before the wolves can out number the villagers.

### UPDATES
10/18/2016 - Initialized the repository and programmed the beginning sequence of the game



### TO DO LIST
- Not sure if the #assign_roles method is working properly, need to write test to make sure that
  the size of the @wolf array is equal to @num_of_wolves

- Create the #take_a_guess method

- Need a game condition #win_or_lose method

This is also an excercise in learning to use .Rspec

Thank you for reviewing my game.
